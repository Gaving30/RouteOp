# RouteOp

The web application was developed in Visual Studio 2015 using the web framework ASP.NET and the programming language C#. 
The frontend consists of the ASP.NET framework, version 4.5.2 and Google APIs V3. 
The content of the site is constructed using HTML elements and styled using CSS, the use of JS and mainly JQuery is used to add a smooth and dynamic experience when using the Web pages. 
The backend will be managed using SQL Server database and connected via C#. 
The C# server-based code connections allow interactions between our front and back end. 
A database will store the data that our site requires and we will use SQL commands to extract the relevant information. 
A Google Maps API will be inserted into the web application UI, creating and easy-to-use frontend for the user. 
The algorithms themselves are done using C# and GAF (Genetic Algorithm Framework) which is a .Net/Mono assembly. 
To improve the appearance of the application, CSS will be used to design. The reason behind using CSS is for consistency across all pages; I can design the page and use that consistent style across all pages within the application.
For design features I use JS, using the JS library JQuery will increase the look of the web pages. It was used to add some slick features to the pages such as pop-out windows, and for creating dynamic pages, links and button. Adding new textboxes for more user entries to the algorithm can be easily done if required on the fly.
The final and main addition to the application will be the mathematical algorithm itself, which was coded up in C#.
To accommodate the websites look on hand held devices, the webpages will be Bootstrap responsive as to function correctly on these smaller mobile devices.
